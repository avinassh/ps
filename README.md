# Problem Solving

[![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-1187941-16/ps)](https://github.com/sangupta/ps)

`ps` is a collection of various computing problems and their corresponding solutions
that I could think of. The problems range in various categories such as design,
algorithms, performance optimizations, and more.

Feel free to add a [Github issue](https://github.com/sangupta/ps/issues) for any
problem that you would like me to work upon. Note that it may take a few days to
answer it.

Dedicated to the friends who inspired me to learn and experiment.

## Problems

The following is a list of the various problems and their solutions:

### Data Structures

* [Discussion on how finding duplicates in integer arrays leads to Bloom Filters](solutions/2016/integer-duplicates-to-bloom-filters.md)
* How to find the top-k IPs hitting a service

### Algorithms

* [Fastest sorting of positive integers](solutions/2016/fastest-sorting-integers.md)
* [Fastest way to merge multiple integer sets](solutions/2016/merge-multiple-integer-sets.md)
* [Fastest way to find duplicates in multiple integer sets](solutions/2016/fastest-duplicates-integer-sets.md)

### Design

* [Find degrees of separation in a social graph](solutions/2016/degrees-of-separation-social-graph.md)
* [Design a stateless user-session mechanism](solutions/2016/stateless-user-session.md)
* Design a scalable user authentication system
* Design a rate-limited web-scraper
* Design a shopping cart
